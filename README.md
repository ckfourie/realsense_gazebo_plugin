# Intel RealSense Gazebo ROS plugin

This package is a Gazebo ROS plugin for the Intel D435 realsense camera.

Note: It has been modified from the original to only make nodes available if the sensor is directly simulated in Gazebo. This allows you to remove some sensors if you wish to speed up the simulation. 

 
## Acknowledgement

This is a continuation of work done by [SyrianSpock](https://github.com/SyrianSpock) for a Gazebo ROS plugin with RS200 camera.

This package also includes the work developed by Intel Corporation with the ROS model fo the [D435](https://github.com/intel-ros/realsense) camera.
